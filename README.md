# DAN

## **What is DAN?**
- The DAN builds an AI service platform that is accessible to everyone and offers a WYSIWYG experience.We have established an economic system for computing power usage on OKC. We have first developed a service based on AIGC (StableDiffusion).Developers use DAN to write APIs for specific image processing effects that address a particular problem and generate targeted API interfaces for realistic photos, cartoon styles, futuristic cities, and other styles and formats. Users do not need to learn any skills or worry about where the computing power comes from. By using the Playground (calling various API interfaces contributed by developers), they can easily create the images they want.
- DAN evolved from the open-source project SDCN, which is an infrastructure for sharing stable diffusion computing power. DAN has gained consensus from the SDCN community

- The current project repository is for participating in the OKX Hackathon on March 26, 2023.
