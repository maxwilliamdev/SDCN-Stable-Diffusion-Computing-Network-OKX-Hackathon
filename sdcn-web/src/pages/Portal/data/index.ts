  'DAN is an infrastructure for sharing Decentralized AIGC computing power.We are an open-source community born based on Stable Diffusion,We firmly believe in AI by the people for the people. The DAN builds an AI image generation service platform that is accessible to everyone and offers a WYSIWYG experience. Developers use DAN to write APIs for specific image processing effects that address a particular problem and generate targeted API interfaces for realistic photos, cartoon styles, futuristic cities, and other styles and formats. Users do not need to learn any skills or worry about where the computing power comes from. By using the Playground (calling various API interfaces contributed by developers), they can easily create the images they want.',
  'We would like to thank the computing power contributors. It is because of their presence that the world is full of freedom and light. We will be unregulated and unconstrained, allowing everyone to enjoy the beautiful life brought by AI computing power.',

    q: 'What is DAN?',
    a: [
      'Decentralized AIGC Network (DAN) is a distributed computing network based on Stable Diffusion. It is an open-source community project that brings together developers, computing power donors, and end-users to build a computing power community. DAN provides a set of atomic operation APIs for Stable Diffusion, allowing developers to combine parameters for specific scenarios to generate new APIs and operation interfaces that are tailored for end-users. Computing power donors with GPU capabilities can join the DAN network by contributing their computing power machines to the distributed computing power leaderboard. DAN simplifies the complexity of text2image and image2image into personalized APIs, and allows individual computing power machines to join the DAN network to gain more computing power resources. We believe in AI by the people for the people.',

    a: [
      "DAN will continue to improve the computing power, models, and APIs required for Stable Diffusion's text2image, image2image, and other capabilities. DAN is a free AI service that is unregulated and not subject to centralized control. Everyone can donate their computing power machines, build basic or Lora models, write API service interfaces, and freely call DAN to generate the content they need. You can explore the painting capabilities of AI through DAN, add AI drawing functions to your web applications through DAN, or use DAN as a productivity efficiency tool. DAN is just the beginning, and there will be more AI services running on the DAN network in the future, allowing everyone to enjoy AI services freely.",

We believe that everyone has the right to use and enjoy AI freely, rather than allowing computing power to be controlled by a few companies or government organizations. In order to improve the network and create value for computing power donors and users, we may consider introducing an economic system to enable DAN to self-develop in the future.',
